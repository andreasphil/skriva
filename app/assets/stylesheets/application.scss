 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all
 * the files listed below. Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative
 * path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other
 * CSS/SCSS files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last
 * require_* statement. It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
